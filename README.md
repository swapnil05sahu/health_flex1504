1. How to Run the Application:

Ensure you have the necessary development environment set up for  React (for web).
Clone the project repository to your local machine.
Navigate to the project directory.
Install dependencies using npm or yarn (npm install or yarn install).
Follow specific instructions for each platform:
For React (web): Start the development server (npm start or yarn start) and open the application in a web browser.

4.Configuration:

Replace 'YOUR_API_KEY' in the code with your actual API key from Tomorrow.io.

5.Testing:
Run the application on various devices and platforms to ensure compatibility.
Test API integration by checking the accuracy of weather data.

6.Issues and Troubleshooting:
Common issues may include API request failures, compatibility issues with different platforms, or environment setup errors.
Troubleshooting steps:
Double-check API key configuration.
Ensure proper installation of dependencies.
Check for platform-specific issues and follow relevant documentation.
